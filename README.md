## Create React Native App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). You don't have to install Android SDK nor Xcode. Just write your app in JavaScript.

See the official guide: https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md

## Available Scripts

Install Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

### `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
